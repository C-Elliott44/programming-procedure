I am learing VueJs as of May 2019. They first project is Anax. 

I am getting data from an API and populating a dropdown with the parent selections.
Based on the parent selection, I am going to populate the second dropdown with children.

Jan 2020 : Using VueJs on twp .Net projects now. Ana and Success and converting some CJ over.
Jan 2020 : Using Angular (again) on PSpring and it helps knowing VueJS.
