Service > SaveMember (not Create or Update)
var srvMember = new Service.Member()
srvMember.Save(data)
Save : Save doesn't imply anything about the state, so they overlap.

Service > Save Function would have 2 paths
1) Update ()
2) Insert ()

DAL > Update
DAL > Insert 

Using : Insert would imply that the item doesn't already exists, i.e. an insert.
Using : Update implies that the item already exists
